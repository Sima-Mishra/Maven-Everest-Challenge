### 📄 **Page 1: The Ultimate Challenge – Everest Overview**

This page gives a high-level summary of expedition activity and outcomes on Mount Everest.

- Over **450+ expeditions** and **6,500+ climbers** have attempted to summit Everest.
- The **overall success rate** is ~**46%**, with the **fatality rate** close to **5%**.
- **Spring** is the most favored season, with the highest volume of expeditions.
- Route analysis shows **South Col (SE Ridge)** and **North Col (NE Ridge)** dominate in popularity.
- The **Expedition Timeline chart** shows a dramatic rise in attempts post-2000, driven by commercial climbs.

📌 *This page sets the foundation with core KPIs, timeline trends, and route/seasonal distribution insights.*

### 📄 **Page 2: Who Dares to Dream – Climber Demographics**

This page dives into the people behind the summit attempts—nationality, age, gender, and accomplishments.

- **Top contributing countries** include the USA, India, UK, and Japan, with varied success rates.
- A **world map** displays climber counts by country, color-coded by success performance.
- Most climbers are aged **30–45**, but younger and older climbers have also succeeded.
- **Male climbers** dominate overall numbers, but female climbers have shown a **higher average success rate in recent years**.
- Notable achievements (youngest summiter, oldest, first female) are highlighted in a dedicated table.

### 📄 **Page 3: The Price of Glory – Risk Analysis**

Focused on danger and mortality, this page uncovers the inherent risks of Everest expeditions.

- The **fatality rate** peaked during the **1990s**, driven by poor weather and limited technology.
- Most deaths occur due to **falls, exhaustion, altitude sickness, and avalanches**.
- The **highest risk routes** include the North Face and West Ridge.
- A **scatter plot** shows that **altitudes above 8,000m** (“Death Zone”) account for most fatalities.
- A **risk matrix** compares gender, age groups, oxygen usage, and season against death and success rates.

📌 *This page demonstrates that while Everest is achievable, it comes with extreme life-threatening risks.*

### 📄 **Page 4: Keys to the Summit – Success Strategies**

This final page uncovers what contributes to successful Everest summits.

- **Oxygen usage** significantly boosts success—climbers using oxygen have **>80% success rate**.
- **Team size matters**: larger teams (16+) show the highest success (~59.5%), while solo or 1–2 member teams fare worse.
- **Spring season** consistently results in the best outcomes.
- A **matrix heatmap** clearly shows that **large teams in Spring = highest success**.
- Additional visuals show that **commercial expeditions** have grown sharply and perform better in terms of safety and coordination.

📌 *This page offers actionable insights for future climbers, expedition planners, and policymakers.*
